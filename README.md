# Small Cat (scat)
A small (235 bytes) `cat` program written in assembly for my amusement.

If you get an error message like this:  
`SYSCALL nr error`  
You can check the exit code to see what the error was

### Build instructions
nasm -f bin scat.asm  
From this you get a 64bit linux binary

### F.A.Q
Q: Why is it called Small Cat?  
A: Because it's small. And because it's funny.
